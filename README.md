# Cyborg

**Cyborg** is a LLM Bot `CyborgGPT` that can be used as a `secure` asistance in your meetings/recorded conversations along with relevant documents, giving you ability to chat on the context of Knowledge Bage (**KB**) created from your data (`meetings/recorded conversations along with relevant documents`). It has no ability to send your data over internet. That's why it is `secure/private/local`
